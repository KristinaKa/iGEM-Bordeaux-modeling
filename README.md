<p>We are members of the Bordeaux team in the iGEM competition. 
This repository contains the code of our application that simulates the growth of transformed bacteria on a solid surface. Detailed information on our project can be found at http://2016.igem.org/Team:Bordeaux/Model </p>

<h1>Directory structure<h1>
<p>The code is divided in two versions. The first one is based on the Donachie's cell division model and the second is based on another model of division (see our wiki for more information). Both directories contain a <i>Modeling</i> directory containing the Object Oriented code linked to the multi agent modeling. </p>

<h1>How to run the application</h1>
To use our application you need 
<ul>
<li>the g++ compiler</li>
<li>the gtkm library</li>
<li>the matplotlib library</li>
</ul>

Each version of the application contains a makefile to compile and you can run the executable <i>interface</i>.
