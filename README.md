We are members of the Bordeaux team in the iGEM competition. 
This repository contains the code of our application that simulates the growth of transformed bacteria on a solid surface. Detailed information on our project can be found at http://2016.igem.org/Team:Bordeaux/Model 

<h1>How to run the application</h1>
To use our application you need 
<ul>
<li>the gtkm library you can see here https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gtkmm/MSWindows how to install it on windows.</li>

</ul>
You can use the makefile to compile and the executable interface to run the application.
